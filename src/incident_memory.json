If the User object is null, return an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP 404 Not Found) to the client and log the event.\n*   Add a try-catch block around the call to `com.app.data.Service.getUserRecord(int)` in `com.app.api.UserHandler.handleRequest`. If a null value is caught, log the error and return an appropriate error response to the client.\n\n**Long-term prevention:**\n\n*   Implement data validation in `com.app.data.Service.getUserRecord(int)` to explicitly check if the user ID exists before attempting to retrieve the record. If the user ID does not exist, return an empty User object or throw a custom exception (e.g., `UserNotFoundException`) instead of returning null.\n*   Enhance logging in `com.app.data.Service.getUserRecord(int)` to provide more detailed information about the failure to retrieve the user record, including the specific data store being queried and any underlying errors. Implement metrics to track the frequency of \"user not found\" events.\n",
